# trendbot

An AI agent that queries Farcaster data for trending casts and autonomously decides which cast would make for the most valueable coin then launches the coin. 

This project uses x402-enabled APIs from Pinata and Neynar, thus making it possible for the AI agent to interact without the need for an account or API key. The AI agent has a crypto wallet and has full access to use it for deploying tokens.
